## Installation

1. Clone repo locally.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Open a new terminal tab in the root, run `webpack` or `webpack -w`.
5. Open another terminal tab, run `nodemon`.
6. Navigate to `localhost:5000`, ensure you have the [CORS Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) installed and on.

So this does the bare minimum right now, and has more than a few bugs, but it's a good place to get started. I think the next step will be learning redux, that'll really help clean up the async actions in the code.
